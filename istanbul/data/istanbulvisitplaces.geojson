{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Aya Sofya", "Description": "It's said that when the Byzantine Emperor Justinian entered his finished church for the first time in AD 536, he cried out \"Glory to God that I have been judged worthy of such a work. Oh Solomon, I have outdone you!\" The Aya Sofya (formerly the Hagia Sophia) was the emperor's swaggering statement to the world of the wealth and technical ability of his empire. Tradition maintained that the area surrounding the emperor's throne within the church was the official center of the world. Through its conversion to a mosque, after the Ottoman armies conquered Constantinople, to its further conversion into a museum in the 20th century, the Aya Sofya has remained one of Istanbul's most cherished landmarks", "longit": 41.0085227, "latit": 28.9792391 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9792391, 41.0085227 ] } },

The vast complex is a dazzling display of Islamic art, with opulent courtyards lined with intricate hand-painted tile-work, linking a warren of sumptuously decorated rooms, all bounded by battlemented walls and towers. Of the many highlights here, the most popular are the Harem (where the sultan's many concubines and children would spend their days); the Second Court, where you can walk through the vast Palace Kitchens and stand in awe at the dazzling interior of the Imperial Council Chamber; and the Third Court, which contained the sultan's private rooms.\nThe Third Court also displays an impressive collection of relics of the Prophet Muhammad in the Sacred Safekeeping Room and is home to the Imperial Treasury, where you're greeted with a cache of glittering gold objects and precious gems that will make your eyes water. To fully see Topkapi Palace, you'll need at least half a day.", "longit": 41.0115195, "latit": 28.9811902 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9811902, 41.0115195 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Blue Mosque", "Description": "Sultan Ahmet I's grand architectural gift to his capital was this beautiful mosque, commonly known as the Blue Mosque today. Built between 1609 and 1616, the mosque caused a furore throughout the Muslim world when it was finished, as it had six minarets (the same number as the Great Mosque of Mecca). A seventh minaret was eventually gifted to Mecca to stem the dissent.\n\nThe mosque gets its nickname from its interior decoration of tens of thousands of Iznik tiles. The entire spatial and color effect of the interior makes the mosque one of the finest achievements of Ottoman architecture. A great sightseeing joy of a trip to Istanbul is wandering amid the gardens sandwiched between the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofya to experience their dueling domes in twin glory. Come at dusk for extra ambience, as the call to prayer echoes out from the Blue Mosque's minaret.\n\nDirectly behind the Blue Mosque is the Arasta Bazaar; a great place for a shopping stop as the handicraft shops here sell high-quality souvenirs. Even if you're not interested in a browse, head here to see the Great Palace Mosaic Museum, which is tucked between the Arasta Bazaar and the mosque. This small museum displays the 250-square-meter fragment of mosaic pavement that was unearthed in the 1950s here.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Basilica Cistern", "Description": "The Basilica Cistern is one of Istanbul's most surprising tourist attractions. This huge, palace-like underground hall, supported by 336 columns in 12 rows, once stored the imperial water supply for the Byzantine emperors. The project was begun by Constantine the Great but finished by Emperor Justinian in the 6th century.\n\nMany of the columns used in construction were recycled from earlier classical structures and feature decorative carvings. The most famous of these are the column bases known as the Medusa stones in the northwest corner with their Medusa head carvings. A visit here is very atmospheric with the columns beautifully lit and the soft, steady trickle of water all around you.\n\nLocation: Yerebatan Caddesi, Sultanahmet", "longit": 41.0083532, "latit": 28.9777267 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9777267, 41.0083532 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Hippodrome", "Description": "The ancient Hippodrome was begun by Septimius Severus in AD 203 and completed by Constantine the Great in AD 330. This was the center of Byzantine public life and the scene of splendid games and chariot races but also factional conflicts. Today, there isn't much of the Hippodrome left to see, except for a small section of the gallery walls on the southern side, but the At Meydani (park), which now stands on the site is home to a variety of monuments.\n\nOn the northwest side is a fountain, presented to the Ottoman sultan by the German Emperor William II in 1898. Then, heading southwest are three ancient monuments: a 20-meter high Egyptian obelisk (from Heliopolis); the Serpent Column brought here from Delphi by Constantine; and a stone obelisk that originally was clad in gold-covered bronze plating until they were stolen by the soldiers of the 4th Crusade in 1204", "longit": 41.0066714, "latit": 28.9762716 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9762716, 41.0066714 ] } },

There are three separate sections in the complex, each of which are worthy of a visit: the Museum of the Ancient Orient; the main Archaeology Museum; and the Tiled Pavilion of Mehmet the Conqueror, which holds a staggering collection of ceramic art.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Grand Bazaar", "Description": "For many visitors, sightseeing in Istanbul is as much about shopping as museums and monumental attractions, and the Grand Bazaar is where everyone comes. This massive covered market is basically the world's first shopping mall, taking up a whole city quarter, surrounded by thick walls, between the Nure Osmaniye Mosque and Beyazit Mosque. The Beyazit Mosque (built in 1498-1505) itself occupies the site of Theodosius I's Forum and has architecture inspired by the Aya Sofya.\n\nEntrance to the bazaar is through one of 11 gates from where a maze of vaulted-ceiling laneways, lined by shops and stalls selling every Turkish souvenir and handicraft you could imagine, cover the area. The various trades are still mostly segregated into particular sections, which makes browsing easier. Near the bazaar's Divanyolu Caddesi entrance is the Burned Column. This stump (still 40 meters high) of a porphyry column was set up by Constantine the Great in his forum. Until 1105, it bore a bronze statue of Constantine.", "longit": 41.0106848, "latit": 28.9658794 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9658794, 41.0106848 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Süleymaniye Mosque", "Description": "Sitting high on the hill above Sultanahmet district, the Süleymaniye Mosque is one of the most recognized landmarks of Istanbul.

The interior, dominated by its soaring 53-meter-high dome is notable for its harmonious proportions and unity of design.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Rüstem Paşa, Spice Bazaar, Erzak Ambarı Sok., Fatih\/İstanbul, Turkey", "Description": "The Spice Bazaar is the place to get your foodie fix of lokum (Turkish delight), dried fruit, nuts, herbs, and, of course, spices. Much of the money that helped construct it came from the taxes the Ottoman government levied on Egyptian-made products, which is why its name in Turkish (Misir Çarsisi) means \"Egyptian Market.\" The Spice Bazaar is one of the most popular things to do, and at certain times of the day gets ridiculously crowded with huge tour groups from the docked cruise ships. Try to come before 11am or after 4pm.\n\nJust next door to the Spice Bazaar's main entrance is the stately Yeni Camii (New Mosque), which was begun in 1615 and finished in 1663 — that's \"new\" for Istanbul. It is worthwhile taking a peek inside while you're sightseeing in the area, as the interior is richly decorated with tile-work and liberal use of gold leaf.", "longit": 41.0165001, "latit": 28.9683307 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9683307, 41.0165001 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Dolmabahçe Palace", "Description": "The sumptuous and ornate Dolmabahçe Palace shows the clear influence of European decoration and architecture on the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Built by Sultan Abdülmecid I in 1854, it replaced Topkapi Palace as the main residence of the sultans. The formal gardens are punctuated with fountains, ornamental basins, and blooming flower beds, while inside the sheer splendor and pomp of the Turkish Renaissance style is dazzling. The interiors mix Rococo, Baroque, Neoclassical, and Ottoman elements, with mammoth crystal chandeliers, liberal use of gold, French-style furniture, and dazzling frescoed ceilings.\n\nLocation: Dolmabahçe Caddesi, Besiktas", "longit": 41.0391643, "latit": 28.9982707 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9982707, 41.0391643 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Chora Church (Kariye Müzesi)", "Description": "Chora means \"country\" in Greek, and this beautiful Church (originally called the Church of St. Saviour of Chora) lay just outside old Constantinople's city walls. The first Chora Church was probably built here in the 5th century, but what you see now is the building's 6th reconstruction as it was destroyed completely in the 9th century and went through several facelifts from the 11th to 14th centuries.\n\nThe church (now a museum) is rightly world-famous for its fabulously vibrant 14th-century mosaics, preserved almost intact in the two narthexes and fragmentarily in the nave, and the frescoes along the walls and domes. These incredible examples of Byzantine artistry cover a wide range of themes, from the genealogy of Christ to the New Testament stories.\n\nLocation: Kariye Camii Sokak, Edirnekapi", "longit": 41.031205, "latit": 28.9369996 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9369996, 41.031205 ] } },

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": " Little Aya Sofya ", "Description": "Before Emperor Justinian built the Aya Sofya, he had to test out if the building would work structurally, so he built this miniature version first. Its original name was the Church of Sergius and Bacchus, but the obvious architectural parallels with the Aya Sofya led to its long-held nickname becoming the building's official title. During the Ottoman era, the church was converted into a mosque and it still functions as a working mosque today. Although its proportions aren't as grandiose as others in Istanbul, the building has been beautifully restored and is well worth a visit.\n\nThe walk here, down narrow alleyways lined with tall Ottoman era buildings — some lavishly restored and others creaking their way into dilapidation — is a tranquil respite from central Sultanahmet.

Even better, as it's less known, you're likely to be able to admire them up close without having to battle any crowds.

Built in the 5th century by the Emperor Theodosius II, the fortress made up the southern section of Constantinople's defensive walls. The mammoth arch (blocked up in the late Byzantine period) was known as Porta Aurea (Golden Gate), with doors plated in gold. When the Ottomans conquered the city, they used the fortress for defense, and later as a prison and execution place.\n\nYedikule has been restored in recent years, and you can climb up to the top of the battlements for superb views across the Sea of Marmara.", "longit": 40.9938545, "latit": 28.9210783 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.9210783, 40.9938545 ] } },
